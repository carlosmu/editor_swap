# Editor Swap (Blender Addon) 
Are you searching for a quick way to swap between editors

You need more space? For example joining the outliner and properties editor?

## What is this addon for? 
This addon will allow you to exchange editors with a button or a shortcut. The linking between editors is fully configurable. You can swap between two or more editors sequentially.

Additionally you can also hide the button if you prefer only to use the shortcut. You can also assign the shortcut of your preference.

## Usage

Click on button on headers of editors, or use the shortcut.
