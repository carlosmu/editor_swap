# Quick Editor Switch (Blender Addon) 
Quick switch between Editors. <br>
I made it to quickly switch between outliner and properties editor. 
Which is especially useful on small screens or when you have very large hierarchies of objects. <br>
The other editors were added later. I hope you find it useful.
